React Todo List

Welcome to my React Todo List project! This is one of my first projects in React and represents a great effort to learn and improve my coding skills. This app is a basic todo list that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Getting Started

To get started with the React Todo List, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running:

sql

npm start

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your web browser.
How to Use

When you open the app, you will see a simple interface that allows you to add tasks to your todo list. Simply enter your task in the input field and click on the Add Task button. Your task will then be added to the list.

You can edit a task by clicking on the task text. This will allow you to change the text of the task. To save the changes, press the Enter key or click outside of the input field.

To delete a task, simply click on the x button next to the task.

Future Development

Add a feature to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Add a feature to filter tasks by their completion status.
Improve the styling of the app to make it more modern and user-friendly.
Add a feature to allow users to create multiple todo lists.
